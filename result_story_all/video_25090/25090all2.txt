### Analysis and Explanation of Ratings:

1. **Frame 0 - Frame 4 (Rating: 10)**:
   - **Content**: "May Contain Content Inappropriate for Children" Screen.
   - **Reason**: These frames serve as a standard disclaimer and are not visually engaging. They are informational and do not contribute to the story or excitement of the trailer.

2. **Frame 5 (Rating: 60)**:
   - **Content**: Close-up of mechanical gears.
   - **Reason**: This frame is visually intriguing as it aligns with the industrial revolution theme of the video. However, its impact is moderate as it doesn't directly showcase the narrative or characters.

3. **Frame 6 - Frame 7 (Rating: 80)**:
   - **Content**: Ubisoft logo with mechanical gear animation.
   - **Reason**: These frames highlight the game's producer, Ubisoft, in a dramatic and visually appealing way. The incorporation of industrial elements enhances immersion and raises viewer interest.

4. **Frame 8 - Frame 9 (Rating: 70)**:
   - **Content**: "London 1868" with a cloudy sky background.
   - **Reason**: These frames set the historical context of the game. While they are essential for establishing the setting, they are less engaging compared to action-packed or dramatic sequences. The visual tone, however, makes them more interesting than the disclaimer frames.

#### Frames 110, 111, 112
- **Content**: These frames prominently display the text "The Darwin and Dickens Conspiracy" with a dramatic backdrop of industrial London, showing iconic figures (Darwin and Dickens) alongside the protagonist in Assassin's Creed attire. The Assassin’s Creed branding and London’s iconic Big Ben create strong historical and thematic connections.
- **Rating**: 85
  - These frames are visually engaging, tying the game's historical narrative to well-known figures. However, they don't include a direct call to action or promotional content, which limits their marketing impact to some extent.

#### Frames 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119
- **Content**: These frames highlight promotional material for the game. The PS4 cover of "Assassin's Creed Syndicate" is displayed alongside a direct call-to-action text: "Reserve Today - Available October 23." The PlayStation branding and tagline "Greatness Awaits" further emphasize the marketing push.
- **Rating**: 90
  - These frames are highly impactful for marketing purposes, as they provide essential information (release date, availability, and platform) and a clear call to action. The content is straightforward and visually appealing, making these frames more interesting from a promotional perspective. 

### Conclusion
While frames 110-112 are compelling for storytelling and setting the thematic tone, frames 113-119 excel in delivering the promotional message, which is critical in the context of a game trailer.

### Analysis of Ratings:
1. **Frame 96 (Rating: 10)**  
   - The frame is completely black, offering no visual or promotional content of interest. This is likely a transitional or placeholder frame, hence the lowest rating.

2. **Frame 105 (Rating: 20)**  
   - This frame introduces the "Join the Family, Get Rewards" promotional content, but it is obscured by smoke effects, making it less visually impactful. While it is relevant to the game's branding, the obscurity reduces its appeal.

3. **Frames 106-108 (Rating: 25 each)**  
   - These frames clearly display the "Join the Family, Get Rewards" promotion with branded items like a hoodie, cap, and bag. The imagery is clean and conveys the message effectively. However, compared to the more action-oriented or plot-relevant frames, these are less engaging.

4. **Frame 111 (Rating: 80)**  
   - This frame is highly interesting as it features the "The Darwin and Dickens Conspiracy" promotional material with the protagonist and historical figures. The inclusion of Big Ben in the background adds to the historical and cinematic appeal, making it a standout frame for fans and viewers.

5. **Frames 116-119 (Rating: 70 each)**  
   - These frames highlight the game's release date ("Reserve Today, Available October 23") along with the game cover. They are visually clear and provide critical information for viewers. However, the lack of dynamic action or story elements keeps them slightly behind Frame 111 in terms of interest.

5. **Frames 123–125 (Rating: 60)**  
   Content: PlayStation branding with the tagline "Greatness Awaits."

### Analysis and Explanation:

1. **Frames 0 to 4**:
   - Content: All these frames display a disclaimer ("May contain content inappropriate for children"). While essential for compliance, it is not visually or narratively engaging.
   - **Rating**: 10 (Low interest as it doesn't contribute to the story or visuals directly).

2. **Frame 96**:
   - Content: This frame is entirely black, likely a transition or filler frame.
   - **Rating**: 5 (Minimal interest due to lack of visual or narrative content).

3. **Frame 105**:
   - Content: Promotional content for Assassin's Creed merchandise. This begins to engage the audience with specific branded items and a call to action ("Join the family").
   - **Rating**: 40 (Moderate interest due to promotional engagement).

4. **Frames 106 to 108**:
   - Content: These frames continue the promotional content showcasing branded merchandise and a website link for rewards. The visuals are slightly more defined and feature iconic Assassin's Creed branding, which may appeal to fans.
   - **Rating**: 50 (Moderate to high interest as the branded visuals and call to action may captivate fans of the series).

### Explanation of Ratings:

1. **Frames 1, 2, 3, and 4**:
   - **Content**: These frames display the ESRB warning, "May Contain Content Inappropriate for Children," which is standard for video games. While this information is necessary, it is not visually engaging or narratively compelling.
   - **Rating (5)**: These frames are rated low because they primarily serve an administrative purpose and do not contribute to the story, action, or visual appeal of the trailer.

2. **Frames 96 and 97**:
   - **Content**: These frames are completely black. While they could represent transitions or pauses in the trailer, they offer no visual or narrative appeal.
   - **Rating (20)**: These frames are rated slightly higher than the ESRB warning because they might be part of a transition in the video, but their lack of content still makes them uninteresting.

### Summary:
All the provided frames are either administrative (ESRB warning) or blank (black screens), offering minimal engagement or interest. As a result, the ratings are low and close in value.
